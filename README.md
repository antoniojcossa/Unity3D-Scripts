# Unity3D-Scripts
This is where i'm going to keep most of my Unity3D Scripts! Feel free to use them and send me some feedback.

I recently updated the FPSMovement script, commenting what each variable does.
I also updated the SpinningCube script, so you can adjust the rotation speed for each axis(x, y and z).
